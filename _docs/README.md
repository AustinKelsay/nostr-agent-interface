# `_docs` Reference Notes

Files in this folder are upstream/reference snapshots (mostly `snstr` and NIP implementation notes).

They are **not** the canonical product docs for Nostr Agent Interface.

For current project positioning and operational guidance, use:

1. `README.md`
2. `llm/README.md`
3. `docs/testing.md`
4. module READMEs under `profile/`, `note/`, and `zap/`

Current positioning: Nostr Agent Interface extends Nostr MCP Server's JARC tool contracts, operates CLI/API-first, and keeps MCP as supported compatibility mode.
